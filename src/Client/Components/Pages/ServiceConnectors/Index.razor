<Template Name="Service Connectors" Features="@features" DocsURL="/docs/configuration">
	<Description>One of the many advantages of running applications on the cloud is the easy availability of a variety of backing services. Steeltoe simplifies using those services by automatically configuring and wiring up connections to common services like Redis, RabbitMQ, MySQL, MS SQL, and more.</Description>
	<WhatIs>Backing services are must when creating cloud-native .NET applications, but managing the connections can be time consuming and annoying. Steeltoe Service Connectors takes that pain away and let you get back to doing what you love.</WhatIs>
	<WhyUse>
		Steeltoe Connectors provide out-of-the-box support for discovering many common services on a cloud platform. They also include the ability to use settings-based configuration so that developers can supply configuration settings at development and testing time but then have those settings be overridden when pushing the application to the platform.
